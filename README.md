Minecraft AI Assistant: Through natural language chat commands, it converts players' construction requirements into mcpi-driven Python code to achieve automated construction in the game.
This program relies on the Minecraft server plugin RaspberryJuice to provide functionality compatible with the Minecraft Pi API.
Install the RaspberryJuice plugin
In order for the AI Assistant to work in Minecraft, you need to install the RaspberryJuice plugin on your Minecraft server. Here are the installation steps:
Step 1: Download RaspberryJuice
  Go to the RaspberryJuice GitHub Releases page and download the .jar file for your Minecraft server version (e.g. raspberryjuice-1.12.jar).
Step 2: Configure the Minecraft Server
  If you don't already have a plugin-enabled Minecraft server (like Spigot or Paper), set one up first.
  Download raspberryjuice-<version> Place the .jar file in the plugins/ directory of your Minecraft server.
  Start or restart your Minecraft server.
